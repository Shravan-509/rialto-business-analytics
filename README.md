## Project Overview

Rialto Decision Intelligence Platform is a Master's Business Analytics capstone project built as a production-style Streamlit application. It transforms `Rialto Data.csv` into a full decision intelligence workflow covering descriptive analytics, NLP, predictive modeling, forecasting, executive AI recommendations, Power BI exports, and automated reporting.

Every KPI, chart, model result, export, and recommendation is generated dynamically from the source dataset. Replacing `data/raw/Rialto Data.csv` with another file using the same schema refreshes the platform outputs.

## Machine Learning Models

Return prediction:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost when installed

Customer satisfaction prediction:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

Customer segment prediction:

- Random Forest Segment Classifier
- Decision Tree Segment Classifier

The platform compares models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC, RMSE, MAE, R2, confusion matrices, feature importance, and SHAP when available.

## Forecasting

Forecasting covers:

- Monthly revenue
- Monthly transactions
- Customer growth
- Satisfaction score

Prophet is preferred. If Prophet fails or is unavailable, the system falls back to ARIMA, then to a naive last-value forecast for constrained environments.

## NLP

The NLP pipeline includes:

- Text preprocessing
- Automatic NLTK resource handling
- VADER sentiment
- BERT sentiment when available
- Word clouds
- Word frequency
- N-grams
- Topic extraction using BERTopic or fallback methods
- Monthly sentiment trends

## AI Features

Generative AI is used only as an explanation and recommendation layer. It does not replace calculations, models, or forecasts.

Supported provider configuration:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
```

Models:

- Gemini: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- OpenAI: `gpt-4.1-mini`

If API keys, packages, network access, or provider calls fail, the platform uses rule-based executive summaries.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Place the dataset at:

```text
data/raw/Rialto Data.csv
```

## Running Locally

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

Open the local Streamlit URL shown in the terminal.

## 🔍 Model Evaluation, Explainability & AI Reliability

Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of both predictive models and AI-generated insights is a key aspect of the Rialto Decision Intelligence Platform. The platform incorporates established evaluation techniques for forecasting models and ensures that AI recommendations are generated from validated analytical outputs.

### 📈 Forecast Model Evaluation

The platform leverages **ARIMA** and **Prophet** models to forecast future revenue trends. Model performance is evaluated by comparing forecasted values against historical sales data to assess prediction accuracy and consistency.

The following industry-standard evaluation metrics are used to measure forecasting performance:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** – Penalizes larger prediction errors and provides an overall measure of model accuracy.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** – Expresses prediction error as a percentage, making results easier to interpret across different scales.

These metrics provide confidence in the forecasting models and help ensure that business decisions are supported by reliable predictions.

### 🤖 AI Recommendation Reliability

The **Executive AI Advisor** generates recommendations exclusively from verified analytical outputs produced by the platform. Rather than relying on external assumptions, it analyzes insights derived from:

- Executive KPIs
- Sales Analytics
- Customer Analytics
- Returns Analytics
- Sentiment Analysis
- Predictive Forecasts

By grounding every recommendation in validated business data, the platform delivers AI-generated insights that are **data-driven, explainable, and aligned with business objectives**. This approach improves transparency, enhances decision-making, and promotes greater trust in AI-assisted recommendations.

## Quality Assurance

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Compile-check Python files:

```bash
python -m py_compile app/main.py src/*.py app/pages/*.py
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication for multi-user access
- Add Docker and CI/CD workflows
- Add richer scenario planning for executive decision support
- Add automated model drift monitoring
- Add database ingestion alongside CSV ingestion
- Add screenshots and a hosted demo link
